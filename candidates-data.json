  "about": "As an AI/ML Engineer passionate about building intelligent, scalable, and real-world solutions, I specialize in designing systems that push the boundaries of what's possible with modern language models and agentic workflows. My current focus lies at the cutting edge of Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and autonomous AI systems.\n\nWith a strong foundation in Python and modern backend frameworks like FastAPI, I develop high-performance inference APIs that interface seamlessly with open-source LLMs such as DeepSeek, Ollama, ChatGPT, and more. My engineering philosophy is grounded in deploying robust, maintainable, and production-grade AI systems that are optimized for real-time interaction and decision-making.\n\nMy day-to-day work involves building RAG applications, crafting domain-aware LLM agents, and orchestrating multi-step pipelines using LlamaIndex, LangChain, and LangGraph. These systems are tailored for tasks like intelligent search, document understanding, multi-modal interaction, and task automation—bridging unstructured data with reasoning capabilities.\n\nA key part of my workflow is deploying and scaling these AI services in cloud environments, especially Microsoft Azure, where I manage containerized deployments, model hosting, and CI/CD pipelines. I’ve deployed LLM-based apps using Azure Functions, App Services, and Container Instances, ensuring availability, observability, and cost-effective scaling.\n\nI’m particularly fascinated by automated AI agents—systems that not only generate responses, but dynamically reason, reflect, and act across tools, APIs, and external environments. I’ve built multi-agent systems capable of autonomous retrieval, task planning, memory retention, and user-driven customization.\n\nBeyond implementation, I actively follow developments in open-source LLMs and AI infrastructure, contribute to community discussions, and maintain a strong focus on the user experience and architectural trade-offs in AI system design.",

  "about": "My Skills are improving day by day. Mathematics and  Physics are the skills of which I am proud most. Programming is also one of the best skills to solve problems in the IT world.  I never knew when I become proficient in writing maybe it was the result of my Reading habit which I developed after my college life. I am an Introvert who loves to meet new people and learn new skills from them. I am waiting for a new education policy to be adapted So, I can complete my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nI am working in the field of AI/ML and AR. I am a Detail-oriented engineer, with get-it-done, on-time, and best quality products. I have proven my skills in AI by modeling some state-of-the-art architectures and algorithms and proved my skills in AR by writing multi-purpose AR modules that work seamlessly on JS, Python, C#, CPP, and PHP (More to Come).\n\nAs a senior developer in AI/ML/DL/computer vision and NLP learned how to train and test model architectures in Pytorch, Tensorflow, Theano, Deepstream, Tensorflow lite, TensorRT, Transformer, etc.... How to perform transfer learning for quick training. How to Combine multiple models and how to change architectures of underlying layers, build model architecture from scratch, etc... \n\nAs a team leader of the AI and AR team learned to manage a team and take the most out of team members. Train them to accept and complete future challenges and help them to improve those skills in which they are lacking. Also learned how to use agile methodology to complete any project while keeping the team motivated and the client satisfied. I was responsible for understanding client requirements and business prototypes and helping them to solve their problem in a modern way including enhancement of user experience, financial growth, increase in production capacity or productivity of employees, reach out to more customers, etc...\n\nI was also responsible for deploying AI, and AR Technology to Mobile, Cloud, and web. So, I am capable of performing basic DevOps duties of CI and CD pipeline building, Rest-API handling, Deployment of the model, and balancing load using the tech stack of Git/SVN, Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes/Docker Swarm in AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.\n\nFor more information, guidance or help feel free to Connect. Let's reduce human effort with the Power of AI and AR and Build a Sci-fi World. Peace...",

As a result of the system, dock yard congestion was reduced by 20%, and the dock yard was able to process goods more efficiently.\n\nI also built a generative AI tool that can create realistic images of products from text descriptions. The tool is used by businesses to create marketing materials, such as product brochures and website images. The tool has been very successful, and has helped businesses to increase their sales.\n\nAdditionally, I worked on Langchain and Pinecone with Whisper to build an end-to-end interview taking bot. The bot can automatically grade interviews and generate reports. The bot has been used by businesses to improve their hiring process, and has helped them to find better candidates."

This leads to missing consumption data, inaccurate billing, operational inefficiencies, and increased manual workload for field technicians.\n\nTo tackle this, we are developing a DLMS-based Android application that empowers technicians to retrieve meter data on-site using an optical probe connected via OTG USB. \nExcited to bring this transformation to smart metering! 🚀 #SmartMetering #DLMS #IoT #AndroidApp #EnergyTech #Innovation\n\n2.📱 Project Overview\nThe MeterSnap app is designed to scan and validate electric meter images quickly and accurately using a mobile phone. It helps field teams ensure correct meter identification, avoid duplication, and generate organized reports automatically.To reduce errors, save time, and simplify the process of capturing and recording electric meter data in the field.\n#FieldUtilityTool #SmartMeterCapture #MeterDataAutomation #OCRMeterReader #QRCodeMeterValidation #UtilityFieldOperations #DigitalMeterLogging #GoogleDriveIntegration #NoDuplicateMeters #FieldDataCollection #SmartEnergyTools #MobileMeterReading #DLMSMeterSupport #MeterBoxManagement #DocumentUploadAutomation #MeterSerialMatching #OfflineMeterCapture #WareHouse"

Resume should be crisp (One page), to the point.\n\n2. Make sure your resume consist of most of the keywords that are present in JD of profile you are applying for and should reflect the skills required by the company, always touch-up the resume before applying.\n\n3. Always go for Quality over quantity. Do not try to learn everything that comes on LinkedIn posts or others are achieving. Follow your passion and polish it.\n\n4. When preparing for tech roles, always follow your own path with your goals.\n\n5. Get comfortable giving interviews by practicing with peers, friends or anyone who is ready to do this exercise.\n\n6. Learn from one source and not get confused by following multiple paths together at one instance of time. (Sources : Youtube, Online Learning)\n\n7. Clear concepts first before going for Competitive Programming.\n\nThanks a lot Priyank Ahuja for organising this event. \nThanks Nikita Sharma for guiding us about getting ready for tech roles in Tech Giants.\n\n***Please like, share & Comments to make this post visible to larger audience.\n\n#linkedin  #tech #quality #onlinelearning #resume #experience #competitiveprogramming #techcommunity #event #audioevent #live #techroles #guidance #jobhunt #jobchange #experienced #freshers #freshersjobs ",

With a strong foundation in NLP and machine learning, I specialize in turning models into real-world products fast, reliable, and built for user impact.\n\nMy recent work involves developing and deploying advanced NLP solutions using modern transformer models such as FLAN-T5, Mistral, and GPT. I’ve built retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines using FAISS and Weaviate, orchestrated with frameworks like LangChain and Haystack, and deployed them across cloud-native environments (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes). I emphasize performance optimization, system reliability, and clean engineering practices, from CI/CD to observability.\n\nI bring a mix of research insight, product thinking, and hands-on engineering experience to everything I build. I'm especially interested in projects that push language understanding forward whether it’s enabling smarter collaboration, streamlining workflows, or delivering meaningful insights at scale.",
